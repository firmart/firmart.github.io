        <description>Background I was looking for a way to classifying images by rating them on the fly. My first attempt was using darktable as suggested in a thread. Indeed, the auto-advance rating mechanism was quite handy. But it is still too heavy for this sole purpose. In darktable, user have to import images before editing metadata. When tens of thousands images are involved, the process of importing images can be quite time-consuming1 as it creates for each image an XMP file to store metadata.</description>

        <description>It has been 18 months that I read &amp;amp; write my emails in Emacs. No need to say I have enjoyed the mouse-free experience brought by Emacs. Recently, I had to keep track a new email account. So I came across my old note written back then which I enhanced in this post. I made lots of updates subsequently including password management through pass, multi-accounts support etc. to make it as complete as possible.</description>

        <title>Migrate from vimwiki to Org mode</title>

        <description>Around 2016-2017, I used vimwiki a lot to take spare notes of Linux, programming &amp;amp; mathematics related topics. I moved from Vim to Emacs in June 2019 for the great Org mode and never came back. Recently, I wanted to get rid of my good old vimwiki directory and merge it in my org-mode personal wiki (using org-glaux). Since it&amp;rsquo;s a one-time task, I decided to use the only available outdated script then write some Emacs code to fix the result instead of patching the old script.</description>

        <title>Consult dictionaries in Emacs</title>

        <description>The most time-wasting thing when learning natural languages or reading literature works is nothing more than consulting a dictionary. During my studies, I came through three stages: paperback dictionary, online dictionary and Google Chrome search engines. The time requiring to consult one entry has decreased from a few minutes to dozens of seconds, but Iâ€™m still not satisfied with this speed.

  Figure 1: A Kangxi Dictionary. It was quite fascinating to read when I was a child.</description>
