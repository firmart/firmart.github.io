[{"content":"It has been 18 months that I read \u0026amp; write my emails in Emacs. No need to say I have enjoyed the mouse-free experience brought by Emacs. Recently, I had to keep track a new email account. So I came across my old note written back then which I enhanced in this post.\nA full back-and-forth cycle of email consists to\n Receive email through a program which synchronize emails locally from an email server. Read email through a program (MUA) whose the UI offers an organized \u0026amp; handy presentation of emails. Compose email in whatever editor. Send email with a mail transfer agent or an interface of it.  I made the following choices which I will detail the configuration throughout this post:\n Receive email: offlineimap. Read email: notmuch.el. Compose email: Emacs message mode. Send email: Emacs function smtp-send-it to send email through an SMTP server.  As you may have seen, except the reception of email, the remaining can be done within Emacs.\nReceiving email As stated above, we use offlineimap to fetch emails from potentially multiple mailbox. But most importantly, we store all emails locally for two purposes: 1. to be able to read emails offline, 2. to not mess up tags synchronization which may cause data loss. You may think that your huge mailbox would take a tremendous place in your disk. Well, I can say that if you pay attention to keep only one copy of your emails, it should not take much. For instance, I have 2.6k emails taking 460MB of the disk.\nConfigure offlineimap Install offlineimap with your favorite package manager1. Then copy the minimal configuration (the path depends on your distribution).\n1  cp /usr/share/doc/offlineimap/examples/offlineimap.conf.minimal ~/.offlineimaprc   Here is the relevant part of my configuration (~/.offlineimaprc) for reference. See the documentation in /usr/share/doc/offlineimap/examples/offlineimap.conf or Archwiki for more information. Note the postsynchook option at the account level: it\u0026rsquo;s an email tagging script which is run as soon as new email arrives. We will come soon to its content in this section. Remember what I said regarding the space taken by locally stored email? Well, they remain tiny provided that they are not duplicated elsewhere. That\u0026rsquo;s not always the case, for instance Gmail may store an email in the folder [Gmail].Important besides [Gmail].All Mail. You may consider to filter out the extra folders you don\u0026rsquo;t want as below with a python\u0026rsquo;s lambda expression or a function (see the documentation).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  [general] accounts = Acc1_Gmail, Acc2, Acc3 # comma-separated list of accounts [Account Acc1_Gmail] localrepository = LocalAcc1 remoterepository = RemoteAcc1 postsynchook = ~/.email/postsync.sh # notmuch tagging script utf8foldernames = yes [Repository LocalAcc1] type = Maildir localfolders = ~/.email/my-acc1@gmail.com [Repository RemoteAcc1] type = Gmail remoteuser = my-acc1@gmail.com remotepass = password sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt readonly = true # readonly if you don\u0026#39;t want mess up with the \u0026#39;unread\u0026#39; tag... folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in [\u0026#39;[Gmail].All Mail\u0026#39;] [Account Acc2] ... ...   Launch offlineimap automatically at boot You would certainly want to launch automatically offlineimap at boot. This can be done with systemd. In my case, I have three accounts, it\u0026rsquo;s advised 2 to create three separated systemd services and set maxsyncaccounts = 1 in ~/.offlineimaprc as we have done above.\nInstead of write three different system service files, I write the following template unit file where the variable %i will match later with an account name in .offlineimaprc. (Note that you should avoid \u0026ldquo;@\u0026rdquo; in the account name since systemd give it a precise meaning).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  # ~/.config/systemd/user/offlineimap@.service [Unit] Description=Sync mail with offlineIMAP for Account %i in .offlineimaprc Documentation=man:offlineimap(1) [Service] ExecStart=/usr/bin/offlineimap -a %i -u basic Restart=on-failure RestartSec=60 [Install] WantedBy=default.target   Then run systemctl daemon-reload to load the new service file. The following commands enable the auto-start on boot and launch the service right now.\n1 2 3  systemctl enable --user --now offlineimap@account-1.service systemctl enable --user --now offlineimap@account-2.service systemctl enable --user --now offlineimap@account-3.service   Note that account-* is the account name appeared in each [ Account XXX ] section. If everything goes well, offlineimap will sync emails on the next boot automatically.\nAuto-tagging with notmuch The next thing to do is email auto-tagging, without this feature your mailbox will be a nightmare. Again, install notmuch with your favorite package manager. We will write the script aforementioned so that email be filtered as soon as they are synced locally.\nConfigurate notmuch Before starting to use notmuch, you must configure it. In particular, you have to set the database path, your email accounts which appeared in ~/.offlineimaprc, tagging rule for incoming email and tag to exclude by default when searching.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  # ~/.notmuch-config [database] path=/home/firmart/.email [user] name=Firmin Martin primary_email=my-acc1@gmail.com other_email=my-acc2@gmail.com; my-acc2@gmail.com [new] tags=inbox;unread; ignore= [search] exclude_tags=deleted; [maildir] synchronize_flags=true   Expose highly active addresses The following command lists email-senders address sorted by decreasing amounts of emails sent3.\n1 2 3  notmuch show --format=json --body=false --entire-thread=false \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; | jq \u0026#39;.[] | .[] | .[0].headers.From\u0026#39; | sort | uniq -c | sort -n   Replace From by To to expose highly active mailing list.\nThe snippet above help us to find out the best contributors of our inbox to tag them properly.\nAuto-tagging script Here is my little shell script ~/.email/postsync.sh which is run once offlineimap finished to sync my emails. You might want to take a look at notmuch help search-terms to understand the syntax of tagging commands.\nI identify several visibility categories of emails:\n I don\u0026rsquo;t want to see them at all and they\u0026rsquo;re harmful =\u0026gt; spam I don\u0026rsquo;t want to see them at all =\u0026gt; blacklisted I want to see them but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter when =\u0026gt; move out inbox It\u0026rsquo;s important! =\u0026gt; tag them more   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59  #!/usr/bin/env bash # ~/.email/postsync.sh # tag_new \u0026lt;tags\u0026gt; \u0026lt;search-term\u0026gt; function tag_new { notmuch tag $1 -- tag:inbox and $2; } # blacklist \u0026lt;search-term\u0026gt; function blacklist { tag_new \u0026#34;-inbox -unread +deleted\u0026#34; $1; } # spam \u0026lt;search-term\u0026gt; function spam { tag_new \u0026#34;-inbox -unread +spam +deleted\u0026#34; $1; } # security \u0026lt;search-term\u0026gt; function security { tag_new \u0026#34;-inbox +Security\u0026#34; $1; } # update : let notmuch process new mails notmuch new # blacklisting notmuch tag -inbox -- tag:deleted and tag:inbox blacklist \u0026#34;from:/.*@.*[.]pinterest[.]com/\u0026#34; blacklist \u0026#34;from:/.*@linkedin[.]com/\u0026#34; blacklist \u0026#34;from:/.*@quora[.]com/\u0026#34; blacklist \u0026#34;from:noreply@medium.com\u0026#34; blacklist \u0026#34;from:noreply@youtube.com\u0026#34; ## this list continue with 100+ addresses ... # ... and spams # `+spam\u0026#39; can\u0026#39;t be found at all in notmuch if `exclude_tags=deleted;spam;\u0026#39; # is set in the [search] section of `.notmuch-config\u0026#39;. spam \u0026#34;from:esf@cnnsimail.com\u0026#34; # ... # Family first tag_new \u0026#34;+family\u0026#34; \u0026#34;from:my-dad@gmail.com or from:my-mom@gmail.com\u0026#34; # Friends # ... # Co-workers # ... # Mailing list tag_new \u0026#34;-inbox +CoqClub\u0026#34; \u0026#34;to:coq-club@inria.fr or [Coq-Club]\u0026#34; # Newsletter tag_new \u0026#34;-inbox +SE.newsletter\u0026#34; \u0026#34;from:do-not-reply@stackoverflow.email\u0026#34; # Universities # ... # Security (accounts/verification code/email confirmation/... etc.) security \u0026#34;from:no-reply@accounts.google.com or accounts-noreply@google.com\u0026#34; security \u0026#34;from:account-security-noreply@account.microsoft.com\u0026#34; # and more ... # From me tag_new \u0026#34;-inbox -unread +FromMe\u0026#34; \u0026#34;from:my-main-gmail@gmail.com or from:univ-account@my-univ.fr or from:my-second@gmail.com\u0026#34;   Reading mail notmuch.el Follow the instructions given on the official website.\nKey-bindings The key-bindings I use are from evil-collection. They are quite different from the default ones. You can define new keybindings for different notmuch views (tree, show, hello, search, message) as below, but usually I rarely tag manually an email (except flagging important one). Instead, I add a new tagging rule as depicted above.\n1 2 3 4 5  (define-key notmuch-show-mode-map \u0026#34;S\u0026#34; (lambda () \u0026#34;delete message and move on\u0026#34; (notmuch-show-tag \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;+deleted\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-unread\u0026#34;)) (notmuch-show-next-open-message-or-pop)))   Compose email Simply C-x m (compose-mail) to composing an email to send. Normally, the From:=/=To: fields can be autocompleted.\nSend email Unless your local system is configured for sending email using sendmail, you may want to access a remote SMTP server.\nSMTP configuration Below is a fragment of my SMTP setup. You should acquire this information from the host (Gmail, your institution, your company etc.)\n1 2 3 4 5  (setq user-mail-address \u0026#34;firmin.martin@host.fr\u0026#34;) (setq smtpmail-smtp-service 587) ; TLS (load-library \u0026#34;smtpmail\u0026#34;) (setq send-mail-function \u0026#39;smtpmail-send-it) ; require smtpmail (setq smtpmail-smtp-server \u0026#34;smtp.host.fr\u0026#34;)   Patch: Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) You may encounter issue regarding the FQDN when sending email. I have the following patch in my configuration coming from here.\n1 2  (when (\u0026gt;= emacs-major-version 25) (setq smtpmail-local-domain (car (split-string (shell-command-to-string \u0026#34;hostname -f\u0026#34;)))))   Addendum: add new mail account To sum up, if you want to add a new email in you workflow, you should\u0026hellip;\n update .offlineimaprc: update accounts, add one more account section plus associated local/remote section; update .notmuch-config: update primary_email or other_email; run systemctl enable --user --now offlineimap@ACCOUNT-NAME.service; (optional) update postsync.sh to tag the email written by you.   Note that, at the time of writing, offlineimap is in the process to port from python2 (2020-01-01 ⚰️) to python3, see OfflineIMAP/offlineimap3. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n OfflineIMAP community\u0026rsquo;s website : No, I\u0026rsquo;m not using maxconnections \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Technically you can aggregate all duplicate email addresses with jq, but you would have to handle the case, comma-separated addresses, and the \u0026quot;First Last \u0026lt;first.last@gmail.com\u0026gt;\u0026quot; notation. It\u0026rsquo;s merely an example after all. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"Read and Compose Email in Emacs with Notmuch","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["emacs","notmuch","email","offlineimap"],"title":"Read and Compose Email in Emacs with Notmuch","uri":"https://firminmartin.com/en/posts/2020-09-17_read_email_in_emacs_with_notmuch/"},{"content":"Around 2016-2017, I used vimwiki a lot to take spare notes of Linux, programming \u0026amp; mathematics related topics. I moved from Vim to Emacs in June 2019 for the great Org mode and never came back. Recently, I wanted to get rid of my good old vimwiki directory and merge it in my org-mode personal wiki (using org-glaux). Since it\u0026rsquo;s a one-time task, I decided to use the only available outdated script then write some Emacs code to fix the result instead of patching the old script.\nPrelude: the power of vimwiki2org I looked for a vimwiki/Org converter, and luckily found a legacy Perl script (written 8 years ago). Well, it\u0026rsquo;s better than nothing. To install, as usual\n1 2 3  git clone https://github.com/fasheng/vimwiki2org cd vimwiki2org sudo make install   After tweaking available options a bit, I came up with this one-liner which outputs the whole vimwiki content into one single Org file vimwiki.org.\n1  vimwiki2org --no-ignore-lonely-header -L fix index.wiki \u0026gt; vimwiki.org   The option -L fix seems necessary to correctly detect subdirectories, such as diary/diary.wiki. The option --no-ignore-lonely-header was necessary to prevent some heading be commented out (for a good reason).\nInterlude: reworking the remaining Fix possible encoding issue An issue I have encountered was the failure to display correctly Unicode. If you have this issue, it means that some characters in the buffer cannot be rendered properly with Unicode. In my case, I have had a .png disguised as a vimwiki file output into vimwiki.org. That messes up the forthcoming steps.\nIf you are not sure, evaluate (M-:) the following snippet on the vimwiki.org buffer.\n1 2 3 4 5  (let ((str (decode-coding-string (buffer-string) \u0026#39;utf-8))) (erase-buffer) (insert str))   Now, save vimwiki.org. If there is a prompt asking you what encoding do you want to choose, then you should examine whether or not vimwiki.org contains weird stuff.\nRemove vimwiki TOC Auto-generated TOC by vimwiki seems unnecessary since Org mode produce TOC when exporting. It\u0026rsquo;s better to remove them as they create unexportable links. Inspired from this snippet, the following snippet removes the content of headline named Contents (i.e. TOCs auto-generated by vimwiki).\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  (let* ((data (org-element-parse-buffer)) (str (progn (org-element-map data \u0026#39;headline (lambda (el) (when (equal (car-safe (org-element-property :title el)) \u0026#34;Contents\u0026#34;) ;; Here we remove the contents from this headline. (setf (nthcdr 2 el) nil)))) (org-element-interpret-data data)))) (erase-buffer) (insert str))   Then, a little \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; regex %g/Contents/d cleans up the remaining empty TOC headlines. 1\nFix headlines Fix Java multiple lines comment I had a converted Java source block containing multi-lines comment like this\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  #+begin_src java/* Comment * on * multiple * lines ********/ #+end_src   vimwiki2org didn\u0026rsquo;t put a comma before asterisk, and that messes up Org mode headlines. I have luckily only one such case, so I corrected it manually.\nFix source block I had some source blocks not correctly handled. Apparently, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that source block failed to convert when the content is in the same line that {{{. Fortunately, only one case hit me. Again, I fixed it manually, but it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to move one line down the content with regex.\nFix markup You may notice that code markup (i.e. `...`) failed to convert properly. A quick evil regex do the job: %s/`\\(.*?\\)`/~\\1~/g.\nFix mathematics equation Well, vimwiki inline \u0026amp; display style maths are not converted at all. To be short,\n {{$ ... }}$ corresponds to inline maths $ ... $ ; {{$%align% ... }}$ corresponds to maths environment \\[$\\begin{align} ... \\end{align}$\\].  And both of them can span on multiple lines.\nEvaluate the following evil regexps in order fixes respectively the previous issues:\n %s/{{\\$%\\(\\w*\\)%\\(\\(.\\|\\n\\)*?\\)}}\\$/\\\\[\\\\begin{\\1}\\2\\\\end{\\1}\\\\]/g %s/{{\\$\\(\\(.\\|\\n\\)*?\\)}}\\$/\\\\[\\1\\\\]/g  Move headline content in Org files The last step is optional, but in my opinion is better to move headlines in separated Org files as they was originally separated as vimwiki files.\nFix internal links We have to make link working again. Depending on whether you are using org-glaux, use one of the following evil regexps that suits you:\n Org mode file link: %s/\\[\\[\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[\\(.*?\\)\\]\\]/[[file:\\1.org][\\2]]/g org-glaux\u0026rsquo;s wiki link: %s/\\[\\[\\(.*?\\)\\]\\[\\(.*?\\)\\]\\]/[[wiki:../\\1][\\2]]/g  Separate contents in Org files If you have kept the outline of vimwiki2org output, i.e. each second-level headings corresponding to a vimwiki file, then the following snippet, inspired from this answer, will output the content of each second-level headline to a single Org file.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  (defun my-org-export-each-headline (\u0026amp;optional scope) \u0026#34;Export each second-level headline to an Org file with the title as filename. If SCOPE is nil headlines in the current buffer are exported. For other valid values for SCOPE see `org-map-entries\u0026#39;. Already existing files are overwritten.\u0026#34; (interactive) ;; Widen buffer temporarily as narrowing would affect the exporting. (org-with-wide-buffer (save-mark-and-excursion ;; Loop through each headline. (org-map-entries (lambda () ;; Get the plain headline text without statistics and make filename. (when (equal (org-current-level) 2) (let* ((title (car (last (org-get-outline-path t)))) (dir (file-name-directory buffer-file-name)) (filename (concat dir title \u0026#34;.org\u0026#34;)) (content)) ;; Set the active region (set-mark (point)) (org-forward-heading-same-level 1) (activate-mark) (setq content (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))) ;; Export the region (with-temp-buffer (insert content) ;; Save the buffer to file and kill it. (write-file filename) (kill-current-buffer))))) nil scope))))   Postlude: how many links are broken ? This little section is reserved for org-glaux users, of whom I am the only one (for now!). After all those steps, we want to make sure that all internal links are correctly interconnected. This is as simple as calling M-x org-glaux-stats! That command produces a statistical overview of the current wiki including the number of broken links. As long as vimwiki files are under the same directories, no broken link is detected in my side. However, since we use relative links (see Fix internal links), they may be broken in the future as soon as they or their target Org files move. I plan to implement (not soon) a \u0026ldquo;safe move\u0026rdquo; feature inside org-glaux which preserves page\u0026rsquo;s link when page moves. But before that I should introduce caching (with e.g. l3kn/org-el-cache) to annihilate links resolving overheads.\n There is probably a better solution with org-element-map, but I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar enough with it. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["vim","emacs","org-mode","org-glaux"],"title":"Migrate from vimwiki to Org mode","uri":"https://firminmartin.com/en/posts/2020-09-12_migrate_from_vimwiki_to_org-mode/"}]
